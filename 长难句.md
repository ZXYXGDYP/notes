# 长难句分析：

## 主语从句

​	能够识别各个名词性从句并翻译出来

#### 如何识别主语从句

**一句话开始可以是主语和状语只要见到由引导词放在句首并且从句后没有被逗号隔开一定是主语从句**

主语从句从句首开始到谓语动词结束，除此以外It..that 通常都是主语从句

**主语从句从that开始到句末结束	**

<!--Whether the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force .-->

<!--It is generally agreed that a person of high intelligence is   one who can grasp ideas readily  ,make distinctions '明辨是非' ,reason logically and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems-->

#### 如何识别宾语从句

只要实义动词的后面由引导词就暂定为宾语从句（状语从句还没有讲，还有可能是状语从句）

I wonder id I can pass the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination smoothly

if 在宾语从句引导词中可以做是否，



#### 如何识别表语从句

只要系动词后面有引导词，就是表语从句



#### 如何识别同位语从句

 只要名词后面有引导词就暂定为同位语从句，(更可能是定语从句)



## 定语从句

#### 什么是定语

​	只要听到…的+名词，…的就是修饰这个名词的定语成分

#### 定语的成分

##### 	形容词做定语

That kind nightingale died at last .

The extraordinary rose turns dark red.

##### 	名词作定语

The singing of the nightingale can make the rose bloom

##### 介词短语作定语

The nightingale out of the window heard the sighs of the youngers 

##### 非谓语动词作定语

That singing nightingale lose its life at last 

##### 从句作定语

The rose which the nightingale exchanged with her life failed to help the students.

##### 形容词性物主代词

#### 定语的位置

**前小后大**

 当一个单词修饰名词的时候通常放在名词前，当多个单词修饰名词的时候通常放在名词后

This is a ~~story~~  fiction about ~~the~~ *a* rose and ~~the~~ *a*   nightingale. 介词短语做定语

The ~~younger~~ *youngster*  *grasping  romance* ~~who knowing love~~ left the party of the prince ~~dancing~~ .

The ~~refused~~ boy ***rejected***  seems   pitiful .

当过去分词修饰名词的时候，即使只有一个单词也要放在名词后

I have something important to tell you .

当形容词修饰不定代词，即使只有一个单词也通常放在名词后。

#### 定语从句的构成

名词+ 引导+句子

#### 定语从句引导词

定语从句的引导词按照先行词的种类分类，分为5类

1. 先行词是人时引导词有：

   ​	who whom whose ~~that~~(正式文体中很少用that)

 2. 先行词是物的时候引导词有:

    ​	that which whose

 3. 先行词是时间引导词有:

    ​	that which when 

 4. 先行词是地点 引导词：

    ​	that which where

 5. 原因时 ：

    ​	that which why

e.g.

- I will never forget the day <u>when</u> I  met you.

- I will never forget the day <u>that</u> we spent .

- You had better have some reason <u>why</u> you are late .

-  You had better have some reason <u>that</u> sounds perfect.



**先行词、引导词在句中充当的成分决定了引导词的用法**



####   定语从句引导词分类新标准

定语从句引导词还可以按照词性来分类，一共吧引导词分成三类

1. 代词（在从句中充当主语或者宾语成分）

who whom that which 

2. 副词 （ 在从句中不能充当任何主干成分）

where  when why

3. 形容词（ 在从句中修饰离他最进 的名词）

whose



PRACTICE .

The rose that the nightingale exchanged with his life   was ~~deserted~~  *discarded*.

~~These doom building looks fantastic~~

Buildings  whose roofs are around looks beautiful.

It has already been ~~proofed~~ *validated*  by ~~a sea of~~  *numerous*  facts that ~~success~~ glories  belongs to people who having  dreams .

Wearing our own shoes not only ~~is~~ *proves*  convenient but also ensures the point that  the feeling of others can be ignored .

The ~~key~~ *point* of the answer seems that who should be responsible for the decline of ethics.

He whose appearance looks indecent proves gracious in  the spirits 

It is *indispensable* that those who ***spare no efforts*** to realize their dreams ~~tries their best to catch their dreams~~ ~~won't be~~ never feel regrettable although glories failed to be achieved
