## 主语从句

​	1能够识别各个名词性从句并翻译出来

#### 如何识别主语从句

**一句话开始可以是主语和状语只要见到由引导词放在句首并且从句后没有被逗号隔开一定是主语从句**

主语从句从句首开始到谓语动词结束，除此以外It..that 通常都是主语从句

**主语从句从that开始到句末结束	**

<!--Whether the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology or vice versa often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force .-->

<!--It is generally agreed that a person of high intelligence is   one who can grasp ideas readily  ,make distinctions '明辨是非' ,reason logically and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems-->

#### 如何识别宾语从句

只要实义动词的后面由引导词就暂定为宾语从句（状语从句还没有讲，还有可能是状语从句）

I wonder id I can pass the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination smoothly

if 在宾语从句引导词中可以做是否，



#### 如何识别表语从句

只要系动词后面有引导词，就是表语从句



#### 如何识别同位语从句

 只要名词后面有引导词就暂定为同位语从句，(更可能是定语从句)



## 定语从句

#### 什么是定语

​	只要听到…的+名词，…的就是修饰这个名词的定语成分

#### 定语的成分

##### 	形容词做定语

That kind nightingale died at last .

The extraordinary rose turns dark red.

##### 	名词作定语

The singing of the nightingale can make the rose bloom

##### 介词短语作定语

The nightingale out of the window heard the sighs of the youngers 

##### 非谓语动词作定语

That singing nightingale lose its life at last 

##### 从句作定语

The rose which the nightingale exchanged with her life failed to help the students.

##### 形容词性物主代词

#### 定语的位置

**前小后大**

 当一个单词修饰名词的时候通常放在名词前，当多个单词修饰名词的时候通常放在名词后

This is a ~~story~~  fiction about ~~the~~ *a* rose and ~~the~~ *a*   nightingale. 介词短语做定语

The ~~younger~~ *youngster*  *grasping  romance* ~~who knowing love~~ left the party of the prince ~~dancing~~ .

The ~~refused~~ boy ***rejected***  seems   pitiful .

当过去分词修饰名词的时候，即使只有一个单词也要放在名词后

I have something important to tell you .

当形容词修饰不定代词，即使只有一个单词也通常放在名词后。

#### 定语从句的构成

名词+ 引导+句子

#### 定语从句引导词

定语从句的引导词按照先行词的种类分类，分为5类

1. 先行词是人时引导词有：

   ​	who whom whose ~~that~~(正式文体中很少用that)

 2. 先行词是物的时候引导词有:

    ​	that which whose

 3. 先行词是时间引导词有:

    ​	that which when 

 4. 先行词是地点 引导词：

    ​	that which where

 5. 原因时 ：

    ​	that which why

e.g.

- I will never forget the day <u>when</u> I  met you.

- I will never forget the day <u>that</u> we spent .

- You had better have some reason <u>why</u> you are late .

-  You had better have some reason <u>that</u> sounds perfect.



**先行词、引导词在句中充当的成分决定了引导词的用法**



####   定语从句引导词分类新标准

定语从句引导词还可以按照词性来分类，一共吧引导词分成三类

1. 代词（在从句中充当主语或者宾语成分）

who whom that which 

2. 副词 （ 在从句中不能充当任何主干成分）

where  when why

3. 形容词（ 在从句中修饰离他最进 的名词）

whose



PRACTICE .

The rose that the nightingale exchanged with his life   was ~~deserted~~  *discarded*.

~~These doom building looks fantastic~~

Buildings  whose roofs are around looks beautiful.

It has already been ~~proofed~~ *validated*  by ~~a sea of~~  *numerous*  facts that ~~success~~ glories  belongs to people who having  dreams .

Wearing our own shoes not only ~~is~~ *proves*  convenient but also ensures the point that  the feeling of others can be ignored .

The ~~key~~ *point* of the answer seems that who should be responsible for the decline of ethics.

He whose appearance looks indecent proves gracious in  the spirits 

It is *indispensable* that those who ***spare no efforts*** to realize their dreams ~~tries their best to catch their dreams~~ ~~won't be~~ never feel regrettable although glories failed to be achieved   

32

#### 定语从句的特殊用法

##### that做引导词时的省略

如果在从句中充当宾语，that可以省略

I enjoy the book (that) my mom bought for me

在分析长难句的时候，如果见到有两个名词或者代词直接放在一起，中间没有被连词或者标点符号隔开，通常都是省略了that的定语从句

to explore the many possibilities we can envisage

##### 区别限制和非限制性定语从句

I love L who is beautiful 限制性

I love L ,who is beautiful 非限制

区别在 分析长难句的时候，非限制性定语从句就相当于插入语可以完全不看

##### 如果先行词和引导词之间有借此，人不用who只能用whom，物不用that只能用which

He is the man <u>from whom</u> we should learn  

I will never forget the day <u>on which</u> I met you 

##### 区别the same…as ; the same … that引导的定语从句

He is the same man as I love

He is the same man that I love 

as 翻译成像，that翻译成是

##### as 和which引导非限制性定语从句

which引导的非限制性定语从句可以修饰整个句子

as引导的非限制性也可以，但是which只能放在主句的后面而as可前可后

He enjoys talking with young ladies which/as drives me mad 

As drives me mad,he enjoys talking with young ladies 

##### 定语从句中which和that区别



33

#### 区别定语从句和同位语从句

​	I have a dream that sounds funny （定语从句

​	I have a dream that I will become a rich lady （同位语从句

1. 相同点 都是先行词+引导词+句子

2. 不同点 

   看从句本身的意思，定语从句是修饰句子的 同位语从句是解释句子的

   看that在句中占没占成分

   定语从句的先行词可以是所有名词，同位语的先行词必须被解释

   定语从句的引导词共有8个，而同位语从句一般都是that（也有whether)

34

#### 定语从句至难点

​		**寻找先行词**

定语从句的先行词是他前面最近的名词

定语从句的先行词是他前面并列的几个名词

定语从句的先行词是他前面的从句 

定语从句的先行词是他前面整个句子

定语从句的先行词和引导词被隔开了 

如何寻找先行词，必须读懂这句话

35

#### 定语从句考点分析

##### 写作

只要在作文中见到名词，都可以有意识的加一个定语成分把句子拉长

Keeping pets can reduce loneliness.

Keeping pets which look cute as well as  healthy can reduce  loneliness of senior citizens who stay at home alone.

Reading books which keep beneficial to physical and mental health can add knowledge .

**万能定语**

which look … as well as 

名词复数： such as ... … …

### 英汉差异对比

36

1.  汉语意合英语形合

2. 汉语多主动 英语多被动

   In the past decades,A variety of actions were adopted by the authorities to prevent disasters

3. 汉语多短句 英语多长句

   Wu Town ,which locates locating near Canal is a water town in ZJ province 

   When I played basketball  I came across a lady on the playground whose son was running 

   Doors will be decorated by couplets whose topics are involved in health, wealth and good luck 

## 状语从句

### 形容词副词的成分

系动词后面作表语

放在宾语后面作补语

放在名词前做定语

副词

修饰实义动词、形容词、整个句子、副词修饰副词 

### 状语的含义

修饰实义动词、形容词、副词、整个句子的部分

#### 引导词分类标准

状语从句的引导词按照引导词的本身意思分类 一共把引导词分为9类 



when 时间状语从句

seeing that 原因从句

1. 时间状语从句

   when while as 当…时

   当while翻译成..时的时候 要翻译成进行时态

   before

   after

   since 自从 主句要

   I have fallen in love with you since I met you 

   the moment = as soon as  

   by the time 

   until  直到。。。才

   not   until  直到。。才

   I'll grasp her hands when romance approaches 

   在所有状语从句中， 如果主句的动作和从句的动作都尚未发生的话 主句用一般将来式 从句用一般现在式表示将来

   I failed to hold her hands when love came 

   区别until 和not until 

   

   

   I will wait here until you come 

   I will not leave until you come 

   区别在于主句的谓语动词是延续性动词还是瞬间动词，如果是个延续性动词就用until，如果是个瞬间动词就用not until 



​		I didn't realize the greatness of mothers until I grew up.

​		when 引导的时间状语从句省略情况

​		When ==I was== a kid , I enjoyed singing songs 

​		when 引导的时间状语从句，如果主句的主语和从句的主语一只，并且从句有Be动词，此时从句的主语和Be动词可以同时省略

  2. 地点状语从句

     where

     This kind of trees grow well where it is moist   

     做地点的通常都是介词短语 很少是从句

3. 原因状语从句

   -  引导词because\ as\ since \in that \seeing that \considering that \now that\given that 

   - 连词 for
   - 介词短语 because of / due to / owing to / thanks to /for the sake of /as a result of

He had an accident because of his carelessness

He had a car accident for he was careless

He had a car accident because he was careless    

4. 目的状语从句

引导词

to  / in order to /so as to

so that/ in order that 

状语可以随便放，但是so that表示目的，通常放在句末不放在句首 

In order to ~~look aboard~~ overlook farther ,we'll ascend higher

We'll ascend higher in order that we overlook farther 

  5.结果状语从句

so… that      such .. that 如此以至于

so后面跟形容词副词，such后面跟名词

so…that 就是替换very

作文中只要出现very的句型都可以写成so。。that

6. 让步状语从句

引导词 although /though /even though /even if /as / while 

while翻译成虽然尽管的意思讲，只能放在句首，不能放在句中

​	as引导的让我状语从句，从句的表语放在句首可以部分倒装			



As I seem ugly , I keep gentle 

Simple as the chart looks , the outlook behind proves far-reaching — national products become increasingly popular Chinese customers.



Raising pets can cultivate the loving heart of kids although they might be injurious to their families or neighbors

7. 方式状语从句

   引导词 as /the way /as if/though  好像 似乎

8.  条件状语

   引导词

   suppose that /supposing that/if/unless /provided that /as long as /so long as 

9. 比较状语从句

you are as beautiful as me 

### 状语和状语从句考点分析

#### 写作

作文中任何一句话旁边都可以加个状语成分把句子拉长

I love you 

Since I met , I love you for my whole life 

I love you in my deep mind
